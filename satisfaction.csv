2020-06-16T16:15:24.371099Z,Natalie,Rutkowski,Regular Cycle,Somewhat disappointed,All female atheletes would benefit from WILD.AI. Elite endurance atheletes would definitely benefit most because they need to stick to a strict training schedule and plan. The would help them to understand why training is more difficult some days than others and helps. I sincerely wish this app/training program was around when I was swimming at an elite level in high school.,"For me, the app provided a framework for me to educate myself on how I‚Äôm feeling at different points throughout my cycle and also encouraged me to listen to my body. It also provided a structures training plan for me to follow as I started to pick up running again. I really wish pools were open this summer because i would love to try the swimming training plans!","Sometimes I need the extra encouragement and reminder to complete training. I grew up doing organized sports that always had a coach present and sometimes self motivation is a challenge for me. possible adding a virtual coach/accountability partner could be helpful for these individual types of endurance sports. Overall though, I really enjoy the app interface and information available on training and nutrition and the graphed data over time."

Perhaps a list of ingredients and their protein contents (& quality?) would be possible? 4) Love the graphs, but their colours are confusing. The coloured lines at the bottom are distracting and make it hard to read the graphs correctly according to colour. It would also be nice if I could click on the graphs to view them in a bigger format. 5) I'd like the reminder for morning/evening log to come at the time that I set it for, not 15 minutes before. 6) A change I made in Strava after my run wasn't updated in this app. Okay, that was a lot of notes but i really do love the app and what you're doing!:)"
